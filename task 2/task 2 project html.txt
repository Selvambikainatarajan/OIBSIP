            <h2>android app development for women safety</h2>
            <h3>project discription</h3>
            <p>Women are adept at mobilizing diverse groups for a frequent cause. They often work
across racial, sacred, opinionated, and intellectual divides to encourage serenity. We are all
aware of importance of women's security, but we must recognize that they should be well
secluded. Women's are not physically powerful as compared to men, in crisis situation a
helping hand would be a relief for them. Many unfortunate incidents have been taking place in
womanâ€™s case. Problems may come from any direction such as women walking on the road
after the work, going to super market or many other reasons for which they go alone. People at
home are not sure of their return safely. Another factor is woman die without knowing the
reason as they attend excursions and industrial trips conducted by the organizations. It happens
due to attacks on woman but not suicides. With the rapid growth of Android user and cheaper
internet cost we can provide a simple medium to create safety awareness among the working
and professional women of young and teen age. Women Safety Application can show you exact
location of the women in help to her relatives, guardian and friends along with the specific
location, where you can go and help it. Women Safety Application system offers the added
protection of being track by relatives on different time interval and different location. We focus
on the proposed model that can be used to deal with the problem of security issue of women
using GPS and GSM based tracking system. And design the application as emergency
application in mobile phones.</p>
